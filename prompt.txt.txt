A system of ponds at a casino in Las Vegas is laid out in a checkerboard pattern.
At one point, the heights of all the ponds in the system were kept at carefully
calibrated heights. They used to be constantly filled or drained as fast as needed
to keep them at their constant, pre-set heights. The water flowing through the
pipes was an amusing spectacle for children to see.
Due to the crumbling economy in Vegas, the pumps in certain of the ponds
no longer function correctly, and the heights of these ponds are no longer directly
controlled by the computer system.
Pipes connect each pond to its four neighbors (east, west, north, south). If a
pond has a broken pump, then water flows through the pipe between two ponds
at a rate that is proportional to the difference in the heights of the water in
those ponds. If a pond’s pump is still controlled by the system, then you may
assume that it’s height remains constant.
One day, someone fills up the ponds to a certain initial height and then just
lets the system take care of itself. Your problem is to compute an estimate of
the heights in all variable-height ponds at equilibrium (that is, when the total
rate at which water flows into each variable-height, broken-pump ponds from its
higher neighbors is equal to the rate flowing out to its lower neighbors, so that
the pond’s height remains constant). The equilibrium height does not depend
on the constant of proportionality that relates differences in heights to rate of
flow.

In the diagram, the interior comprises the ponds inside the square. The
numbers inside the ponds indicate the waters equilibrium height above ground
level to the nearest centimeter. The dashed lines are pipes. The unconnected
pipes leading from the ponds along the exterior are connected to sources (or
sinks) that maintain the external ponds at the heights shown.
The input to your program (in a file named ponds.txt) will be the initial
heights of the ponds in grid format, separated by comma. Variable-height ponds
will be indicated by an exclamation point in front of the number. For example,
the input for the square shown above would be as follows.
0,300,200,200,300,0
100,!174,!167,!161,!153,50
100,!130,!133,!123,!100,50
100,!112,!114,!97,!74,50
100,!106,!112,!77,!50,50
0,100,150,50,0,0
